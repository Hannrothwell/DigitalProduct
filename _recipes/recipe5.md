## Ingredients

### Crust

* 1 cup hazelnuts, roasted, ground 
* 1/2 cup brown sugar
* 4 tablespoons butter, melted 

### Filling

* 4 ounces white chocolate, finely grated 
* 8 ounces cream cheese, softened
* 1/4 cup sour cream 

### Topping 

* 2 cups blueberries 
* 1/4 cup sugar 
* Zest of one lemon 
* White chocolate shavings 

## Method 

### Crust 

Line bottom of a 9-inch tart pan with parchment paper. Mix crust ingredients and press into pan bottom and slightly up the sides. Chill.

### Filling 

Melt white chocolate in double boiler over hot but not boiling water. Stir constantly. In a separate bowl, whip cream cheese for 3 minutes. Add the melted white chocolate; beat for another minute. Add sour cream; beat until very smooth. Using a star tip and pastry bag, pipe filling to the crust in concentric circles, starting in the centre. Fill entire crust; chill until firm.

### Topping

Rinse fresh blueberries and toss with the 1/4 cup sugar. Heap the blueberries on top of the filling. Garnish with lemon zest and white chocolate shavings.
